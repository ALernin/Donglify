## Why copy a dongle key?
You may be aware of the fact that you can use a dongle copy to share a USB dongle over a network. This enables multiple computers to access the information contained within the dongle simultaneously. Not all hardware keys are designed to allow this type of network licensing. They are meant to be used by an individual computer. To use these types of dongles with several machines requires you to employ third-party software tools to copy a _USB key dongle_.
Another situation that you may face is attempting to access a USB dongle that is connected to a physical host from within a virtual machine. In this case, you will need to copy the USB dongle and redirect it to your virtual environments such as VMware or VirtualBox.

## USB dongle key copy software
[**Donglify**](https://www.donglify.net/) is a software application that is extremely useful when faced with the question of “How to copy a dongle USB key?”.
This software tool was developed to enable the virtualization of USB security dongles and redirect their communication over a network. Using the app lets you share your HASP key attached to your local device with any network-connected computer. The program is fully compatible with the Windows operating system.

Simple way to copy a USB dongle:

1. First, you [sign up for Donglify](https://account.donglify.net/user/registration/) on its official website. Then [download the app](https://www.donglify.net/download/) and install it on all computers that need to get a USB dongle copy. Also, make sure to install the program on the PC to which your physical dongle is attached directly (we’ll call it a device server).
2. Next, start the USB dongle key copy software on the server computer and sign in to your account.
3. Once done, click the “Plus” icon in the window that will open and you’ll see the list of local USB dongles available for sharing.
Note, there should be the “Multi-connect” or “Single-connect” icon next to a USB dongle you are going to copy. The first one means you can copy USB key dongle and it will be accessible to several remote machines simultaneously. “Single-connect” means your dongle key copy will be available for use on only one machine at a time.
4. Select the required USB dongle by checking the radio button in front of it and click “Share”.

In the app’s window, you’ll see the list of devices available for connection.
